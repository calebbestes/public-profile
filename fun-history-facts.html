    <h1>Fun History Facts</h1>
    
    <div class="fact">
        <h2>Fact #1: Napoleon Was Once Attacked by Bunnies</h2>
        <p>In 1807, Napoleon Bonaparte was ready to celebrate a military victory with a rabbit hunt, but things got weird. Instead of scurrying away, hundreds of bunnies charged right at him! Turns out, they had no fear of the little guy — he was <em>literally</em> chased off by a horde of fluffy, adorable rabbits.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="fact">
        <h2>Fact #2: A Japanese Emperor Had His Own Food Taster — A Samurai!</h2>
        <p>The Japanese shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu was so paranoid about getting poisoned that he appointed a samurai whose entire job was to taste his food first. We like to think he was the world’s first picky eater...with a very loyal stomach protector.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="fact">
        <h2>Fact #3: George Washington Never Had Wooden Teeth</h2>
        <p>It’s true! The first president’s dentures were made of ivory, gold, lead, and even human and animal teeth. He probably had the fanciest (and most uncomfortable) smile around. And to think people call <em>modern</em> dentistry scary.</p>

    <div class="fact">
        <h2>Fact #4: Einstein Was a Ladies' Man...but He Couldn't Drive!</h2>
        <p>Yes, the man who figured out the mysteries of space-time had no idea how to drive a car. Imagine explaining relativity but not parallel parking! To be fair, with that brain, he probably didn't have time for driving lessons.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="fact">
        <h2>Fact #5: Thomas Edison — Too Hardcore for Sleep</h2>
        <p>Thomas Edison claimed he only needed three to four hours of sleep a night. He thought sleep was a waste of time. Yet, rumor has it he kept beds in his workshop for quick power naps...a bit contradictory, but when you’re inventing the lightbulb, maybe you’ve earned it.</p>
